==+== A. Overall merit
==-==    An evaluation of the current state of the work under the model
==-==    that it is under review for a hypothetical top-tier conference
==-==    organized by MIT PL.  The contents of the review should provide an
==-==    explicit justification for the score, including, for example,
==-==    suggested revisions.
==-==    
==-==    
==-==    The scores of 2 and 3 indicate that the submission has a set of
==-==    well-scoped revisions that -- if executed -- would lead the
==-==    reviewers to recommend the paper for acceptance.
==-==    
==-==    
==-==    The distinction between minor (Score 3) and major revisions (Score
==-==    2) are that major revisions are those for which the outcome of the
==-==    revision may affect the decision to recommend the paper for
==-==    acceptance.  For example, if the reviewers were to request a new
==-==    experiment that if unsuccessful would preclude them from
==-==    recommending the paper for acceptance, then that experiment would
==-==    be a major revision.
==-==    
==-==    
==-==    A score of 1 indicates that the submission requires a set of
==-==    revisions that do not have a clear scope. In essence the reviewers
==-==    are unable to envision a/the complete version of the work. 
==-==    
==-==    
==-==    For example, if the reviewers have significant trouble
==-==    understanding the submission's approach and cannot suggest a
==-==    well-scoped set of changes that would settle their understanding,
==-==    then a score of 1 would be appropriate.
